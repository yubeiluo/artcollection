##Breaking Bad
1. [To my other favorite W.W.”: Walt Whitman’s poetic influence on Breaking Bad](http://criticalmargins.com/2012/09/19/to-my-other-favorite-w-w-walt-whitmans-breaking-bad/)
 
By season 5, his motivation is control and greed. Yet Walt operates as if he is entitled to have control, that this

type of control will bring him some type of freedom. This is a conflicting freedom, though, as the more control he has, the more sinister he becomes. His vision of freedom  is one of emperor: freedom through control of others.

Freedom is both blessing and curse, and a nation that believes in liberty is also one that suppresses and controls

certain parts of its population and goes to war with itself over that control.
